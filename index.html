                <h3>How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety</h3>
                <h4>Do you love your cat? Well, no self-respecting cat mom or dad would let their baby grow up without a solid grounding in gun safety.</h4>
                <p>Not only does this resource cover gun safety, which can be at times a difficult subject to breach with your kittens, it also covers abstinence, drugs, and satanism!
                    Nine lives arent an excuse to be ignorant of the dangers as well as the ups and downs of living a healthy and safe life, free from gun-related accidents.
                    With this book you’ll sleep easy, knowing Whiskers has all the tools that he needs to go out into the world in a safe and positive manner.</p>

                <h3>Outwitting Squirells: 101 Cunning Stratagems</h3>
                <h4>The full title is quite the mouthful. “Outwitting Squirrels: 101 Cunning Stratagems to Reduce Dramatically the Egregious Misappropriation of Seed from Your Birdfeeder by Squirrels”</h4> 
                <p>Do squirrels always seem one step ahead of the game to you? I know they did for me… but after this book, I can call them thoroughly and utterly outwitted.
                    Honestly, I can say that now as I walk down the street, the squirrels turn their heads as to not make eye contact. It’s truly a liberating feeling.
                    There are, as the title suggests a full 101 stratagems within these 240 pages, and honestly, it proves itself to be the best guidebook out there since the 2nd, and 1st edition.</p>

                <h3>A Field Guide to Dumb Birds of North America</h3>
                <h4>You may be outwitted by the smart ones, but these ones are more in your grasp.</h4>
                <p>There is a difficult problem to solve in national parks, as people often leave behind (rudely I might add) trash quite often near the trash cans, but surprisingly not always within them, as some of the bins have bear proofing. A park ranger was quoted:
                    “There is a significant overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest people.”
                    This book is for those people (and those bears).
                    Seriously, if you’ve tried birding, but the red cardinal and the blue Herron look no different to you. The nuance of focusing the binoculars escapes you, and you’re nearly giving up… now you can look at birding from a whole different, slightly less sophisticated angle in a way that will bring you joy for the rest of your life.
                    Also good for birder friends who are a little over the top. You know who they are.</p>
